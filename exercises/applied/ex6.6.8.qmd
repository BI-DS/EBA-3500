# Exercise 6.6.8 {.unnumbered}
> In this exercise, we will generate simulated data, and will then use this data to perform forward and backward stepwise selection.

## (a)
> Create a random number generator and use its normal() method to generate a predictor X of length n = 100, as well as a noise vector " of length n = 100.

```{python}
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=313)
n = 100
x = rng.normal(n)
eps = rng.normal(n)
```

## (b)
> Generate a response vector Y of length n = 100 according to [a cubic model, where you choose the coefficients.]

```{python}
beta0 = 2
beta1 = np.pi
beta2 = 3
beta3 = 1/3

y = beta0 + beta1 * x + beta2 * x**2 + beta3 * x**3 + eps 
```

## (c)
Forward stepwise selection can be done using the ISLP package. Scikit learn does not support it, neither does
