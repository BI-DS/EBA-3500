# Decision tree classifiers and impurity

Recall that decision tree classifiers are optimized by minimizing and impurity criterion on each branch. (ISLP, Chapter 8.1.2) 

The entropy and the Gini index are both measures of uncertainty about the outcome of a discrete random variable. 

**Gini index**
$$G(p)=\sum_{k=1}^K p_k (1-p_k)$$

**Entropy**
$$H(p)=-\sum_{k=1}^K p_k \log p_k$$

1. $G(p) = H(p)=0$ if and only if $p_k=0$ for all $k$ except one. 
2. Both are maximized when $p=(1/k,1/k,\ldots,1/k)$. 
3. The functions are symmetric in $p$.
