# Weigth loss with serious intermittent fasting


```{python}
KCAL_PER_KILO = 7700
```

```{python}
def lost(days, kcal_out_per_day, kcal_in_per_day):
    total_kcal = (kcal_out_per_day - kcal_in_per_day) * days
    return total_kcal / KCAL_PER_KILO
```

A decent way to eat $2000$ calories is to have one kilogram of sirloin steak, which is very lean, with approximately $100$ kcal per 100 grams, have $10$ small eggs for roughly $540$ kcal. Then you still have some leeway. Another option is 1 kilogram of rib eye, which is approximately $200$ kcal.

```{python}
lost(7, 2600, 2000 / 5)
```



Controlling calorie expenditure is hard, but reaching $2600$ on average should be doable for a reasonably active male.

$60$ minutes of vigorous spinning may, optimistically, burn $800$ kcal. Two such sessions a day would burn $1600$. If one can reach $2600$ doing daily activities, then $4200$ is possible. This results in a loss of $\approx 3.5$ kilos per week.

```{python}
print(f"{lost(7, 4200, 2000 / 5):.2f}")
```
