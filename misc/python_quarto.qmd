# Software to install

We use the following software in the course, available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

1. The newest stable version of [Python](https://www.python.org/), at least version 3.12. Be sure to update, as we might use features not available on your current installation. I can't guarantee Anaconda will work.
    * Windows users: You must check add Python to path.
    * Upgrade `pip` using `pip install --upgrade pip`.
    * We also need the following packages, installed using `pip install`.
    * `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, `jupyter`,  `scipy`, `pandas`.
2. The technical publishing system [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
3. The code editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can use other editors, but they need to support Quarto. I only support VS Code.
    * Quarto.
    * Python.
    * Black.
    * (Optional.) Python Snippets for Data Science.
