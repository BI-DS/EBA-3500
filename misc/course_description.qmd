# EBA3500 Data science with scikit-learn

## Introduction
In this course, we will embark on an exciting journey into the realm of artificial intelligence and data science. Machine learning, a subset of AI, empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

Throughout this course, we will leverage the power of scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly libraries for machine learning in Python. Scikit-learn provides a rich set of tools for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and much more. 

This course will equip you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to tackle real-world problems involving classification and regression.

## Learning outcomes - Knowledge
* Knowledge of basic concepts of machine learning such as bias-variance trade-off, the Bayes error, the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, training error and validation error.
* Definition, interpretation, and properties of some of the most popular machine learning methods.
* Understanding of machine learning workflows, including data loading, preprocessing, fitting, and model evaluation.

## Learning outcomes - Skills
* Basic loading, cleaning, and exploration of data.
* Fitting basic classifiers, including logistic regression, latent discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and naive Bayes.
* Run and make informed choices among linear regression.
* Splitting data into test and training sets.
* Construct estimator pipelines.
* Perform regularized regression such as ridge and lasso.
* Usage of non-linear features such as polynomials and splines.
* Using principal component analysis in conjunction with regression or classification methods.
* Make informed choices between different models using cross-validation.

## General competence
During the course, students will also improve their general programming and presentation skills, and practice working in teams.

## Course content
This courses introduces the students to machine learning using Python and scikit-learn. The students will use scikit-learn to work with all parts of the machine learning, such as data loading, preprocessing, model fitting, and model evaluation. Moreover, the students will learn about basic machine learning methods.

## Learning process and requirements to students
The course will be a combination of lectures and tutorials. 

Please note that while attendance is not compulsory in all courses, it is the studentâ€™s own responsibility to obtain any information provided in class that is not included on itslearning or in the text book.
