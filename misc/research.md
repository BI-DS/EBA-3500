* Ethos

## Introductory speech

1.
* Jonas, from Norway, doctor of mathematical statistics.
* I teach and research statistics and machine learning.

2. 
* Admire effective verbal communication.
* Think about well-crafted Youtube videos. They are enjoyable not only due to the content, but due to the mastery of the content creators.
* Neymar is entertaining to look at because he is so good, 
* Dislike poor communication, especially hedging of statements and displaying the subservient kind of uncertainty.
* Uncertainty of the kind "I am not skilled enough", "I don't know enough".
* Real uncertainty of the kind "no one really knows that", on the other hand, is superb!
* If you are wrong, even fundamentally, and stupidly wrong - that's ok!
* Speeches and presentations are important to me in numerous ways.
    * I need to communicate to students.
    * I need to communicate to colleagues.
    * There are many important insights I need to communicate to the public at large.

3.
* Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist at Oxford, known theoretical work such as the book "The Selfish Gene". 
* But mostly for criticising religion, via the book The God Delusion.
* He is a brilliant speaker. 
* His words carry content, even deep content.
* He appears open, but still emits and aura of certainty.
* He has no difficulty being confrontational in his earnest goal of truth and understanding.
* In addition to all surface elements of a good speech - for a speaker to be effective, he must convince you that he's worth listening to.
* Part of that is his credentials.
* But equally much, it's his demeanor and voice - he needs to be confident, maybe also overconfident!
* This is called "ethos" in rhetorics, by the way.
* Being underconfident can be really bad.
* For instance, a colleague of mine started her course - for bachelor students - stating "I am not really a specialist in this field".
* That's how you lose an audience!

    * GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem is not important.

    * Even if you're working with important problems in fluid dynamics - what is your marginal contribution?

T: There are some *potentially* important topics for pure mathematics.
I.   Epistemology and evaluation.
