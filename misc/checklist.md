# Goals of the course

1. Produce professional reports of basic exploratory data analysis.
2. Apply basic machine learning algorithms to real data.
3. Understand foundational machine learning methods and concepts.

# Checklists for essay

This is a checklist for computational essays, roughly in order of importance. 

## The most important
Not getting these right can result in 0 points. Failing on any of the points 3--6 are especially serious, as it can result in being expelled from school. 

1. [ ] The essay compiles. 
2. [ ] My group number is clearly visible, along with which exercise is being solved.
3. [ ] I give credit when I copy code from external sources. (The course material is exempt from this requirement.)
4. [ ] All use of AI such as ChatGPT has been acknowledged. I have made sure that any generated code does what it should. We strongly recommend avoiding ChatGPT in this course.
5. [ ] I have not plagiarized anything, i.e., copied text from a website without placing it in quotes and providing the source.

## Clarity and correctness
1. [ ] All exercises are correctly labeled using a header.
2. [ ] The exercise text has been reproduced in quotes. 
3. [ ] I have made an attempt to answer every exercise.
4. [ ] I have answered the question(s) posed by each exercise.
6. [ ] I provide references to the literature whenever I use techniques not covered by the course.

## Style
1. [ ] I have used a spellchecker such as Code Spell Checker to avoid obvious mistakes.
2. [ ] The precision of all displayed tables, numbers, and figures are appropriate.
3. [ ] I have hidden superfluous code from the report using `echo: false`. If in doubt, use `code-fold: true`. 
4. [ ] I use inline code to report isolated numbers.
5. [ ] Tables and figures are labeled and referenced.
6. [ ] Tables and figures have captions and descriptions. 
7. [ ] Any correlation matrices and similar tables are colored and easy to read.
8. [ ] Especially important values in tables are high-lighted.
9. [ ] Any use of exploratory functions such as `sns.pairplot()` and `df.corr()` has been appropriately commented.

## Data preparation
1. [ ] The data is correctly imported with an appropriate index column.
2. [ ] The types of the columns in the imported data set are correct.
3. [ ] NAs have been removed if appropriate. 
4. [ ] Columns have been splitted when needed.

## Data leakage
1. [ ] The data is being split into training and test sets at the beginning of the analysis. 
2. [ ] I use pipelines for data transformations used in modelling.

## Exploration
1. [ ] I have looked at the correlation matrix between numerical variables and reported the most interesting findings, including potential collinearity problems.
2. [ ] I have looked at the McFadden's pseudo-$R^2$ for nominal variables, with special focus on the target variable (if any).
3. [ ] I have looked at the pair plot for numerical with special focus on non-linearities.
4. [ ] I used, e.g., `lmplot` to look for interactions between variables and reported my findings.
5. [ ] Used e.g. `catplot` to investigate interactions between 
6. [ ] I have remembered what the research question is.

## Modelling
9. [ ] Any correlation matrices are colored and easy to read.
10. [ ] Any use of `sns.pairplot()` has been appropriately commented.

## Best practices
1. [ ] I have read the documentation and done exploratory analyses in an attempt to identify feature leakage.
2. [ ] I have avoided training leakage.





## Basics
1. [ ] My name (deliveries) is present in the delivery. For exams, the group number is present.
2. [ ] Every quote has been referenced properly.
3. [ ] I give proper credit when I copy code.
4. [ ] All use of AI such as ChatGPT has been acknowledged. I have made sure the code does what it should.

## Style
2. [ ] The number of plots in the main document is kept at a manageable level.
2. [ ] The exercise text has been reproduced in quotes. 
3. [ ] The precision of all displayed tables is appropriate.
4. [ ] I have used a spellchecker to avoid obvious mistakes.
5. [ ] I have hidden superfluous code from the compiled report using `echo: false`.
