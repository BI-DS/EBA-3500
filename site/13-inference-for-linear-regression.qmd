::: callout-note
**Update 9/11.** Added exercises and curriculum.

## Curriculum
* James et al., Chapter 3.4 - 3.5

The methods used in Chapter 3.4 are implemented in [here](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/linear_regression_diagnostics_plots.html).
You need to code for the class `LinearRegDiagnostic` into `Python` and run it. Make sure to important statsmodels using `import statsmodels` first. If you don't, it won't work. 

You may want to take a look at the "official" slides for the chapter, found [here](https://www.statlearning.com/resources-python).

## Exercises
The exercises this week overlap with last week, since the chapter is so large.
All exercises (except those about KNN) are relevant and recommended.

#### Conceptual
