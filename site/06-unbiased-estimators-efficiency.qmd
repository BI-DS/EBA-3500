## Curriculum

### Core readings
1. Dekking et al., Chapter 19: Unbiased estimators
2. Dekking et al., Chapter 20: Efficiency and mean squared error

## Exercises

### Chapter 19
* 19.1a: You need to integrate the uniform distribution.
* 19.2: Do this with pen and paper!
* 19.3 
* 19.4a: Use simulations for this. Recall that an unbiased estimator has to be unbiased for all $n$.
* 19.5: You need to figure out the expectation of $M_n$.

## Chapter 20
* 20.5
* 20.8 Calculate the variance of $T$!
* 20.10
