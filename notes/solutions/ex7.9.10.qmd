# Exercise 7.9.10
> This question relates to the `College` data set

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
college = pd.read_csv("data/College.csv", index_col = 0)
college["Private"].replace({"Yes": 1, "No": 0}, inplace = True)
college.head()
```

## (a)
> Split the data into a training set and a test set. Using out-of-state tuition as the response and the other variables as the predictors, perform forward stepwise selection on the training set in order to identify a satisfactory model that uses just a subset of the predictors.

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = college.drop(["Outstate"], axis = 1)
y = college["Outstate"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, 
                                   random_state=313,  
                                   test_size=0.20,  
                                   shuffle=True) 

```



```{python}
from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector as SFS
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
linreg = LinearRegression()
sfs = SFS(linreg, n_features_to_select = "auto", scoring="neg_mean_squared_error").fit(X,y)
coefs = sfs.get_feature_names_out()
coefs
```

## (b)
> Fit a GAM on the training data, using out-of-state tuition as the response and the features selected in the previous step as the predictors. Plot the results, and explain your fndings.
